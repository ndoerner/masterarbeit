See Varian p. 462ff 
Three types of price disrimination are generally considered. 
Under **first-degree price discrimination**, companies sell different units of output for differen prices *and* these prices may vary from person to person. Thus, under this regime of perfect price discrimination, individual consumers may face personalised prices.
Under **second-degree price discrimination** different units of output are sold for different prices. Prices only vary accross units (bundles) but not across consumers implying that **self selection problems** may arise.
**Third-degree price discrimination** pricing regimes where different consumers face different prices but given units (types) of product are sold for the same price to any consumer. Here, discriminiation is based on product differentiation where prices across the suppliers product range vary but all consumers pay the same price for a given unit of product.
